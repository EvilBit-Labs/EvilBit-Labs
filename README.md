# EvilBit Labs LLC

**Tools that just work — even when the internet doesn’t.**

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **EvilBit Labs LLC**, a micro-lab dedicated to building high-quality, local-first security tools for red and blue teams operating in the real world — including airgapped labs, restricted networks, and places the cloud forgot.

We’re not a startup. We’re not chasing funding. We just build tools we wish we had — and then give them away (or sell the shiny bits on top).

## Mission

We build operator-side security tools that:

- **Work offline** — by default, not by exception
- **Respect your privacy** — no telemetry, no nonsense
- **Deploy easily** — think static builds, minimal deps, single binaries
- **Feel polished** — not just “works on my box,” but genuinely smooth

Our projects reflect 30+ years of real-world experience in government, industrial, and airgapped environments. EvilBit Labs exists to make real security work easier — not to monetize attention or run a SaaS playbook.

## Featured Projects

Here’s a sampling of what we’re cooking (or already shipping):

- [`opnDossier`](https://github.com/EvilBit-Labs/opnDossier) — OPNsense config parser & analyzer with beautiful Markdown/mermaid output. Know what your firewall is _really_ doing.

## Design Principles

- **Offline-first** — Works on a USB stick, not just in the cloud
- **Operator-owned** — You run it, you control it
- **Minimal dependencies** — Static binaries, Docker optional
- **Respect the user** — No spyware, license servers, or surprises
- **No startup bullshit** — No investor decks, no growth hacks

---

## Philosophy

We don't want your data. We don’t want your telemetry. We want your respect.

We publish tools when they’re ready. We respond to issues when we can. If something breaks, maybe open a PR. Maybe don't. Either way — no guilt, no hustle, no SLAs.

EvilBit Labs is where we go to build things we’re proud of, not things that please shareholders.
